## Professional Experience
I have been working at this [Dollar General](https://stores.dollargeneral.com/mo/fulton/20603/) in particular for almost a year now, which,
weirdly enough, was also my first job. I guess I was a bit of a late bloomer in terms of
getting a job, but it has honestly shown me how much I enjoy working with people, not _all_
people of course, but when I go too long without socialization I tend to become a loathsome
hermit.
