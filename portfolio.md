## Portfolio

This one is a bit tricky, because I actually did intend to showcase my code, but unfortunately
I am [extremely tired](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-deprivation) and don't know how to code in _HTML_, I know, I'm sorry. But I do hope you
enjoyed... this, in all its limited capacity.
