## Education
Ironically, despite this being my education page, I'm not exactly sure how well educated
I would consider myself as of right now, and to no fault of anyone's but my own. But in 
spite of that, I was originally empassioned to join IT due to the many doors it opened into
the entertainment industry, hence the [Certificate in Media Technology Design](http://catalog.missouri.edu/collegeofengineering/additionalcertificatesminors/cert-media-technology-design/) and a Minor 
in Art. At this point, however, I don't know what I am or what I like anymore. My _expected_
 graduation is likely innaccurate, but it's all I got besides my high school diploma.

**University of Missouri**
- Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
- Certificate in Media Technology Design
- Minor in Art

Expected Graduation: May 2026
