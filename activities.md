## Activities
I previously particpated more in extracurricular activities and organizations, as of lately 
I have fallen apart, lost motivation, lost track, and ultimately feel as if I've lost myself
in the midst of it all. In all honesty I have considered dropping out or changing my major, 
but none interest me. But when I did previously engage in school, besides [fencing](https://mizzourec.com/programs/sports-competition/club-sports/fencing/), I was a 
part of the Office of Undergraduate Research.
