# Resume
## Jon Asher Daniel
This is my attempt at making a resume using GitHub pages, something that I admittedly have
no experience in beyond the instructions provided in the links given. Of course it won't be
entirely accurate, for the sake of privacy, but I will do my best to fulfill most of the
requirements despite my severe lack of knowledge. I am doing this as my mid term project for
[Information Technology 1000](https://www.coursicle.com/missouri/courses/INFOTC/1000/), Section 
01, and I hope I don't dissappoint too much.
